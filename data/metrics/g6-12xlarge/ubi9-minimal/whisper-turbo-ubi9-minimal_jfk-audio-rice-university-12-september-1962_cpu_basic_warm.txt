President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley and Congressman
Miller, Mr. Webb, Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your
President having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first
lecture will be very brief. I am delighted to be here, and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this
occasion. We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a state noted for
strength, and we stand in need of all three. For we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade
of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases,
the greater our ignorance unfolds. Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that
the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that this nation's own
scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that
of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered
and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension. No man can fully grasp how far
and how fast we have come. But condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man's recorded history in a time span of
but a half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of
the last 40 years, advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago, under
this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago, man learned
to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year.
and then less than two months ago
during this whole
50 year span of human history
the steam engine
provided a new source of power
Newton explored
the meaning of gravity
last month
electric lights and telephones
and automobiles
and airplanes became available
only last week
did we develop penicillin
and television and nuclear power
and now if America's new
spacecraft succeeds
in reaching Venus
we will have literally reached the stars
before midnight tonight
this is a breathtaking
pace
and such a pace cannot help
but create new ills
as it dispels old
new ignorance
new problems
new dangers
surely the opening vistas of space
promise high costs
and hardships
as well as high reward
so it is not surprising
that some would have us stay where we are
a little longer
to rest
to wait
but this city of Houston
this state of Texas
this country of the United States
was not built by those
who waited
and rested
and wished to look behind them
applause
this country was conquered
by those who move forward
and so will space
William Bradford
speaking in 1630
of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony
said that all great and honorable actions
are accompanied with great difficulties
and both must be enterprised
and overcome
with answerable courage
if this capsule history of our progress
teaches us anything
it is that man
in his quest for knowledge
and progress
is determined
and cannot be deterred
the exploration of space
will go ahead
whether we join in it or not
and it is one of the great adventures
of all time
and no nation
which expects to be
the leader of other nations
can expect to stay behind
in this race for space
those who came before us
made certain
that this country
rode the first waves
of the industrial revolution
the first waves
of modern invention
and the first wave
of nuclear power
and this generation
does not intend
to founder in the backwash
of the coming age of space
we mean to be a part of it
we mean to lead it
applause
for the eyes of the world
now look into space
to the moon
and to the planets beyond
and we have vowed
that we shall not see it governed
by a hostile flag of conquest
but by a banner of freedom
and peace
we have vowed
that we shall not see space
filled with weapons
of mass destruction
but with instruments
of knowledge
and understanding
yet the vows
of this nation
can only be fulfilled
if we in this nation
are first
and therefore
we intend to be first
in short
our leadership
in science
and industry
our hopes
for peace
and security
our obligations
to ourselves
as well as others
all require us
to make this effort
to solve these mysteries
to solve them
for the good
of all men
and to become
the world's leading
spacefaring nation
we set sail
on this new sea
because there is
new knowledge
to be gained
and new rights
to be won
and they must be won
and used
for the progress
of all people
for space science
like nuclear science
and all technology
has no conscience
of its own
whether it will
become a force
for good or ill
depends on man
and only if
the United States
occupies a position
of preeminence
can we help decide
whether this new ocean
will be a sea of peace
or a new terrifying
theater of war
I do not say
that we should
or will go
unprotected
against the hostile
misuse of space
any more
than we go
unprotected
against the hostile
use of land
or sea
but I do say
that space
can be explored
and mastered
without feeding
the fires of war
without repeating
the mistakes
that man has made
in extending his writ
around this globe
of ours
there is no strife
no prejudice
no national conflict
in outer space
as yet
its hazards
are hostile
to us all
its conquest
deserves the best
of all mankind
and its opportunity
for peaceful cooperation
may never come again
but why
some say
the moon
why choose this
as our goal
and they may
well ask
why climb
the highest mountain
why 35 years ago
fly the Atlantic
why does rice
play Texas
we choose
to go to the moon
we choose
to go to the moon
we choose
to go to the moon
in this decade
and do the other things
not because
they are easy
but because
they are hard
because that goal
will serve
to organize
and measure
the best
of our energies
and skills
because that challenge
is one
that we're willing
to accept
one we are unwilling
to postpone
and one we intend
to win
and the others too
it is for these reasons
that I regard
the decision
last year
to shift our efforts
in space
from low to high gear
as among the most
important decisions
that will be made
during my incumbency
in the office
of the presidency
in the last 24 hours
we have seen
facilities
now being created
for the greatest
and most complex
exploration
in man's history
we have felt
the ground shake
and the air shattered
by the testing
of a Saturn
C-1 booster rocket
many times
as powerful
as the Atlas
which launched
John Glenn
generating power
equivalents
to 10,000 automobiles
with their accelerator
on the floor
we have seen
the site
where five
F-1 rocket engines
each one
as powerful
as all eight engines
of the Saturn combined
will be clustered together
to make the advanced
Saturn missile
assembled
in a new building
to be built
at Cape Canaveral
as tall
as a 48 story structure
as wide
as a city block
and as long
as two lengths
of this field
within these last
19 months
at least 45 satellites
have circled the earth
some 40 of them
were made
in the United States
of America
and they were
far more sophisticated
and supplied
far more knowledge
to the people
of the world
than those
of the Soviet Union
the Mariner spacecraft
the Mariner spacecraft
now on its way
to Venus
is the most
intricate instrument
in the history
of space science
the accuracy
of that shot
is comparable
to firing a missile
from Cape Canaveral
and dropping it
in this stadium
between the 40 yard lines
transit satellites
are helping
our ships at sea
to steer
a safer course
tireless satellites
have given us
unprecedented warnings
of hurricanes
and storms
and will do the same
for forest fires
and icebergs
we have had
our failures
but so have others
even if they
do not admit them
and they may be
less public
to be sure
to be sure
we are behind
and will be behind
for some time
in manned flight
but we do not
intend to stay behind
and in this decade
we shall make up
and move ahead
the growth
of our science
and education
will be enriched
by new knowledge
of our universe
and environment
by new techniques
of learning
and mapping
and observation
by new tools
and computers
for industry
medicine
and the home
as well as the school
technical institutions
such as rice
will reap
the harvest
of these gains
and finally
the space effort
itself
while still
in its infancy
has already created
a great number
of new companies
and tens
of thousands
of new jobs
space
and related industries
are generating
are generating
new demands
in investment
and skilled personnel
and this city
and this state
and this region
will share greatly
in this growth
what was once
the furthest outpost
on the old frontier
of the west
will be the furthest outpost
on the new frontier
of science
and space
Houston
your city of Houston
with its manned
spacecraft center
will become the heart
of a large scientific
and engineering community
during the next five years
the National Aeronautic
and Space Administration
expects to double
the number of scientists
and engineers
in this area
to increase its outlays
for salaries
and expenses
to $60 million a year
to invest some $200 million
in plant
and laboratory facilities
and to direct
or contract
for new space efforts
over $1 billion
from this center
in this city
to be sure
all this
costs us all
a good deal of money
this year's space budget
is three times
what it was
in January 1961
and it is greater
than the space budget
of the previous
eight years combined
that budget now stands
at $5,400,000,000
a year
a staggering sum
though somewhat less
than we pay
for cigarettes
and cigars
every year
space expenditures
space expenditures
will soon rise
Samoa
from 40 cents
per person
per week
to more than 50 cents
a week
for every man
woman and child
in the United States
for we have given
this program
a high national priority
even though I realize
that this is
in some measure
an act of faith
and vision
for we do not now know
what benefits await us
but if I were to say
my fellow citizens
that we shall send
to the moon
240,000 miles away
from the control station
in Houston
a giant rocket
more than 300 feet tall
the length of this football field
made of new metal alloys
some of which have not yet
been invented
capable of standing heat
and stresses
several times more
than have ever been experienced
fitted together
with a precision
better than the finest watch
carrying all the equipment
needed for propulsion
guidance
control
communications
food
and survival
on an untried mission
to an unknown celestial body
and then return it
safely to earth
re-entering the atmosphere
at speeds
of over 25,000 miles per hour
causing heat
about half that
on the temperature
of the sun
almost as hot
as it is here today
and do all this
and do all this
and do it right
and do it first
before this dictate is out
then we must be bold
I'm the one
who's doing all the work
so we just want to stay cool
for a minute
however I think
we're going to do it
and I think that
we must pay
what needs to be paid
I don't think
we ought to waste any money
but I think we ought
to do the job
and this will be done
in the decade of the 60s
it may be done
while some of you
are still here at school
at this college
and university
it will be done
during the terms of office
of some of the people
who sit here
on this platform
but it will be done
and it will be done
before the end
of this decade
and I am delighted
that this university
is playing a part
in putting a man
on the moon
as part of a great
national effort
of the United States
of America
many years ago
the great British explorer
George Mallory
who was to die
on Mount Everest
was asked
why did he want to climb it
he said
because it is there
well space is there
and we're going to climb it
and the moon
and the planets
are there
and new hopes
for knowledge
and peace are there
and therefore
as we set sail
we ask God's blessing
on the most hazardous
and dangerous
and greatest adventure
on which man
has ever embarked
thank you
